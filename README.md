# Predictive Sales Forecasting Model

## ðŸš€ Overview
Machine learning model to predict sales trends (85% accuracy) and reduce stockouts by 20%.  
**Deployed as a FastAPI endpoint** for integration with business tools.

Sales Forecasting Project 
Summary
Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, Flask/FastAPI, Docker, Airflow/Prefect, Tableau/Power BI

Key Achievements:

Developed a time-series ML model with feature engineering (lag features, rolling averages, seasonality) and hyperparameter tuning.
Achieved 85% accuracy (or 15% MAE improvement).
Deployed the model as a REST API (Flask/FastAPI) for real-time integration with BI tools (Tableau, Power BI) and ERP systems.
Business Impact:

Reduced stockouts by 20% through proactive inventory planning.
Improved demand forecasting accuracy, leading to $X in cost savings (if quantifiable).
Key Steps & Techniques Used:

Data Prep & Feature Engineering:
Cleaned & transformed raw sales data (handled missing values, outliers).
Engineered time-based features (day-of-week, holidays, rolling averages).
Applied log-transform to handle skewed sales data.
Model Development:
Compared Random Forest, XGBoost, and ARIMA for optimal performance.
Used cross-validation & hyperparameter tuning (Optuna/GridSearchCV) to minimize MAE/RMSE.
Deployment & Integration:
Containerized the model (Docker) and deployed via FastAPI.
Automated retraining pipeline (Airflow/Prefect) for weekly updates.
Business Integration:
Connected to inventory management systems to trigger purchase orders.
Built a Tableau dashboard for real-time sales vs. forecast tracking.
